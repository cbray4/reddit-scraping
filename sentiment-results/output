He said it was always a long play. Dude coulda cashed out and walked away. Instead he exercised his options and fucking HELD. Then the big swingin' dicked, mother fuckin sick fucked-up mother fucker proceeded to buy 50,000 more shares at $38ish ($9.50 post split) putting him at 150,000 shares. . . Are ya done yet? Nope. Here comes DFV with the steel chair, 50,000 more shares at $144ish ($36ish post splivy)!!!!!!!!!! Bah Gawd that's DFV with 200,000 (800,000 after split) shares of GME. Holding the championship belt and the intercontinental title simultaneously. P.S. I'd be willing to bet he has added more!!!! P.S.S. Imagine if somehow he knew the cycles and added a few million more shares through options. The only way the most awarded post in Reddit history gets overshadowed. . . . DFV'S DRS I WANNA SEE DFV'S PURPLE CIRCLE ;) :D

DFV cannot be interviewed anymore. He has passed on from this physical realm and transcended into pure energy. A folklore hero, I have no doubt many academic papers, books, movies and songs will be written of him. Seriously though, I do believe down the line..long after Moass and the subsequent negative spin from the media and thier empire...and during the positive waves wealthy altruistic GME investors make in the world...he will be tracked down and be willing to meet with Joe Rogan.

darth_butcher commented on 11/24/2022, at 13:01:17:
I am fully convinced that he would love to stream and talk about GME again. He has done hours of streaming about GME in the past and was so enthusiastic about it. You could tell his heart was in it and that creating content was something he particularly enjoyed. When you're a creative mind like that, you get the most joy from sharing your content with the world and getting feedback from the community.

colonel_wallace commented on 11/24/2022, at 14:26:05:
I'd like to commend GMEdd for creating amazing content and information and for everything the site has done for GME. I'd also like to acknowledge that Joe Fonicello has spoken to the media and streaming services about *his* Gamestop story (I've seen him in at least three series about Gamestop now). While he has every right to tell his story, it's important that his voice does not speak for all retail investors who buy GME. There is a reason apes on Superstonk don't speak to media. My concern is we should be vigilant of having someone be a consistent representative or face of who retail investors are, which is why there was discussion on Superstonk about talking to the media in the first place.

Now that I think about it, having a zoom conference with Atobbit, queen Kong, RC and DFV would really be something‚Ä¶.

I'll say the unpopular thing: DFV just needs to stay away. I care for his sanity and his family's safety as any of my own. He dedicated so much time and effort towards educating plebs and GME DD. He has done his DD, shared it with the class, and is enjoying the spoils of the war. He fought battles that led him to the very steps of Washington DC during the tumultuous CV-19 Era. Should he enter the war against Wall Street again, he exposes himself, and his family, to enormous risk posed by the vultures and other carrion on Wall Street, MSM, and in Washington. Stay away u/deepfuckingvalue. We admire you, but for your own sake just keep walking. We got this.

Anyone who posted good DD has been threatened into silence. Mods were paid off and threatened and forced to go into silence. Even people like me who just have a little karma got reporter for suicide threats. I can only imagine what they have said to DFV. I guarantee you they billionaires have made it clear if he speaks about gme again, they will kill him
